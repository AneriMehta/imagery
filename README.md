# Imagery

Imagery is a slack bot that takes any uploaded image, hosts it on Imgur and posts the link to the same channel after deleting the uploaded image, thus, saving space on a free plan.

# Setup

Deploy this app on heroku and install the app on slack. Create account on Imgur and get a `Client-ID`
Add `slack_access_token` and `client_id` to the environment variables in Heroku config.


# TODO

- [] Add support for other types (?)

# Contributions

PRs and feature suggestions welcome! :D
